Play with fire, and watch the whole thing burn.

Well jorrd, as i stated before. Take it down and i'll opensource it. So as you requested, here you go.

Files included in this source:
- Gameplay.rbxl: Gameplay (ingame)
- Main.rbxl: Main Place (Lobby)

Instructions:
1. Open Main.rbxl and publish it as a new place.
2. Go To Game Settings -> Security And enable Allow HTTP Requests, Enable Studio Access to API Services, Allow Third Party Sales and Allow Mesh / Image APIs
3. Go To View -> Asset Manager -> Places, right click and create a new place. then right click on the place and rename it to Gameplay.
4. Open Gameplay.rbxl and select Publish As, Then overwrite the Gameplay place you just created.
5. Go back to Main.rbxl the one you just published.
6. Go To View -> Asset Manager -> Places, right click on Gameplay and Copy PlaceID
7. Go To ServerScriptService -> Server -> Matchmaking -> Matchmaker, Replace "81750718951429" With the PlaceID you just copied.

Congrats! Your all setup, please keep in mind that this might get taken down, Accounts being banned is not my fault.
Preferably do this on a alt account.
